            <p>
                Daily stand-up with my team, strategic meetings with leadership, training or syncing with team members, and making progress on individual research projects (e.g. exploratory interviews, validity testing, usability testing, monitoring analytics, reporting on feedback).
        
        
        <h4>WALK US THROUGH YOUR CAREER JOURNEY. HOW DID YOU GET TO WHERE YOU ARE NOW?</h4>
        I've always loved design and code. I started coding in high school and was hired by my CS teacher to help work on the school's website. I got my BFA in graphic design and did freelance design work, including web design. I went to a front-end development bootcamp to transition to a full-time dev career and fell in love with UX along the way. I started doing UX design and then transitioned to UX research. I grew into a management role by growing with the company and building out the team I now lead.

        <h4>TIME MACHINE: WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO YOUR ENTRY-LEVEL SELF?</h4>
        Don't freelance. Find a solid team with a good set of mentors producing high quality work at a design-led organization, and you'll learn faster than you could ever hope to learn on your own. Focus on education (formal and informal), portfolio-building, networking, experience, and your resume.
        
        <h4>WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON RIGHT NOW?</h4>
        At my day job I'm implementing user feedback collection and automated response engines for two newly launched products. At night I teach a UX/UI Design bootcamp for Columbia University. In my free time I'm doing UX design and research for a social media platform, mentoring for Hue, organizing and hosting a monthly UXR discussion group for Product Hive, and finishing my thesis for an MS in Instructional Technology and Learning Sciences. Next week I'm attending <a href="https://uxrconference.com/">UXRConf</a>.
        
        <h4>WHAT EXCITES YOU THE MOST ABOUT WORKING AS A UX RESEARCHER?</h4>
        I love providing mentorship for people pursuing UX careers. I love having autonomy to work on what I think is important, and impacting our organization and its users positively. I love being challenged and experiencing career growth.
        
        <h4> WHAT ADVICE DO YOU HAVE FOR BEGINNER FOLKS WHO ARE LOOKING TO PLANT ROOTS & BEGIN A CAREER IN YOUR FIELD?</h4>
        Focus on education (formal and informal), portfolio-building, networking, experience, and your resume. Seek out mentorship, invest in the community, and focus on career-building more than any one job. Plan on seriously job-hunting every year if you want to experience rapid growth. It's completely possible to double your salary every year for the first three years of your career. And always remember that UX is an ethical pursuit. It's your responsibility to protect your users from a high-tech dystopian nightmare future. That's on you. Above all else, act as a user advocate. Everything else will follow.
        
        <h4>WHAT PART OF THE HIRING PROCESS DO YOU PERSONALLY FEEL IS THE MOST IMPORTANT?</h4>
        First, the recommendation. Build your network. Second, the resume. Get experience listed in any way possible—a project counts as a job at a startup if you take it seriously enough. Third, the portfolio. Produce good work, and perpetually build out a polished archive. Fourth, the interview. Be knowledgeable about your craft, prepared with anecdotes, and well-rehearsed.
