        <h4>HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN A UX DESIGNER?</h4>
        For the two clients I was freelancing for most recently, Zown and Qwzrd, I was with them for 9 and 7 months, respectively.
        
        <h4>WHAT DO YOU DO?</h4>
        Conduct user research, create wireframes, mockups, and clickable prototypes, conduct user tests, design style guides, oversee developer handoff and design review, and present findings to stakeholders.

            It depends where I am in the design process. Early on in a project, I might be focused on talking with users to understand their pain points around a specific process, like for Zown, I spoke to a lot of restaurant managers and ride-share drivers about their experiences with the handoff of food orders from restaurant to driver. Further along, I might spend the day building out wireframes and linking them up in InVision, or recruiting users to do usability testing and scheduling and conducting those testings, and iterating the design for a smoother UX.



            <h4>WALK US THROUGH YOUR CAREER JOURNEY. HOW DID YOU GET TO WHERE YOU ARE NOW?</h4>
            I started off as a psychology major, because I was always interested in how people think about and interact with the world around them. That lead me to a job as a clinical research coordinator in healthcare research, and one of the studies I was coordinating I involved a patient safety app, and I actually had to do usability testing on the app. I was really intrigued by that experience, and started taking night courses in UX at UC Berkeley, totally fell in love with UX design, and started freelancing as a UX designer. At that I point I decided to leave my job as a research coordinator and pursue a Master's degree in interdisciplinary design at NYU. In between the two years of my degree, I interned with Adobe, as a part of their XD voice team, and I worked on voice prototypes that were focused on making more accessible user experiences. I also worked as a TA for an introduction to assistive technology class, focused on accessible design. Once I graduated, I started working for two different start-ups as a UX designer and also started working at the Columbia UX/UI bootcamp (because I love UX and I love teaching!) and applying for full-time positions, and that got me to here!

            <h4>TIME MACHINE: WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO YOUR ENTRY-LEVEL SELF?</h4>
            Don't get discouraged by how many rejection letters you get--it's not personal. Put yourself out there and be friendly and introduce yourself to a ton of other designers, because people like to work with people they like! Ask your friends who are more experienced in the field tons of questions, they won't mind, and you can return the favor when you have more experience.
            
            <h4>WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON RIGHT NOW?</h4>
            Right now I am wrapping up a bunch of projects for my clients, but I'm mostly focused on the educational start-up, Qwzrd, and organizing all the assets for the next UX designer who is coming on board so it will be a smooth transition.
            
            <h4>WHAT EXCITES YOU THE MOST ABOUT WORKING AS A UX DESIGNER?</h4>
            I really like being a designer. I like uncovering user problems through interviews, I like understanding their thought process and what might be factoring into their interacting with a product, and I like considering how to incorporate that into a solution that works for them. I also like noticing great UX in the products I use, and mentally bookmarking it for reference in my own designs.
            
            <h4> WHAT ADVICE DO YOU HAVE FOR BEGINNER FOLKS WHO ARE LOOKING TO PLANT ROOTS & BEGIN A CAREER IN YOUR FIELD?</h4>
            Invest in your portfolio. Show strong, detailed case studies that exemplify your understanding of the design process. Pretty mock-ups are less important than research, prototyping, user testing, and then making changes based on your user tests. Critique is a gift, it means someone cares enough about your work to help you make it better. When you are doing a redesign of an existing site, don't tear it down when you present your work-- neutrally discuss the problems that existed in the previous version-- you never know who designed something.
            
            
            <h4>WHAT PART OF THE HIRING PROCESS DO YOU PERSONALLY FEEL IS THE MOST IMPORTANT?</h4>
            The interview process. Presenting yourself as confident and knowledgeable and friendly goes so far. A job can teach you a lot of things, but it cannot teach soft skills like conflict resolution, or being pleasant and detail-oriented and on-time, so any opportunity you have to demonstrate that you should take advantage of.
