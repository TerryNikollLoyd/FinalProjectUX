            <p>
                My workday varies depending on the project I am working on. But it is part meetings with stakeholders, part research, part design.

        <h4>WALK US THROUGH YOUR CAREER JOURNEY. HOW DID YOU GET TO WHERE YOU ARE NOW?</h4>
        I started off in graphic design in the apparel industry. I felt like I reached a plateau in that industry so I decided to go to school at night for UX Design. I felt like UX Design was a good fit for me because I always want to learn new things and make people's lives easier. 

        
        
        <h1>" My advice would be to never stop learning, join UX communities of your choice to network, and approach everything with an open mind."</h1>
        
        <h4>TIME MACHINE: WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO YOUR ENTRY-LEVEL SELF?</h4>
        I would advise myself to reach out to more people in the industry for advice and contacts. I would also advise to be careful who you listen too and never be afraid to be yourself. 

        <h4>WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON RIGHT NOW?</h4>
        I am working on the user flow and design for a database dashboard.
        
        <h4>WHAT EXCITES YOU THE MOST ABOUT WORKING AS A UX RESEARCHER?</h4>
        I work with a great team and a company that sees my growth as a designer as an asset. 
        
        <h4> WHAT ADVICE DO YOU HAVE FOR BEGINNER FOLKS WHO ARE LOOKING TO PLANT ROOTS & BEGIN A CAREER IN YOUR FIELD?</h4>
        My advice would be to never stop learning, join UX communities of your choice to network, and approach everything with an open mind.
        
        <h4>WHAT PART OF THE HIRING PROCESS DO YOU PERSONALLY FEEL IS THE MOST IMPORTANT?</h4>
        Depending on the process of the company I think the presentation of your portfolio and if applicable design exercises.
